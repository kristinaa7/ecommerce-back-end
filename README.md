# E-Commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
The following application is a fully functioning e-commerce wesite using an Express.js API along with Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL database. My role as a developer in this assignment was to successfully build the back end for this business site using the already created front end code.

## Usage
Download Insomnia and create different folders for Products, Categories, and Tags. To begin, start by downloading the required packages by inputting ```npm install``` in the terminal. Start up the server following the commands: 
```npm run seed``` 
```npm run start```

From there, you can open up Insomnia and create different get, post, delete, put routes to view the variety of products, categories, and tags. You are also given the option to pull information by Id, create your own product/category/tag, update a specific item and delete by Id.
